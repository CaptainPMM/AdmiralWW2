#### Ship Control
Click on own ships or their UI panel to select a ship. The selected ship name is colored other than white.  
In the right corner you can set the ship speed and the course by scrolling over the compass.  
The compass needle indicates the desired course, the blue ship drop indicates the current ship course.  
In the left corner is the water ingress indicator and damage indicator.  
The numbers represent the amount of holes in the hull in each section. The progress bar indicates how much water is in the section.  
The more holes the faster water gets into the section.  
Water in sections reduces the ship's hitpoints.  
If the ship has no more hitpoints it will sink.  
There are the following damage types:
* Hull damage (decreases the hitpoints)
* Water ingress
* Turret (turret is disabled)
* Rudder (ship cant change rudder anymore)
* Engine/Propeller (ship cant accelerate anymore)

To select a fire target right click on an enemy's ship or ship panel.  
It will be colored other than white after that and your compass should indicate the direction to the ship in orange.  
Now your ship will open fire, and the shots should get better and better.  
To deselect a target right click anywhere other than enemy ships.

> You are now ready for the seas, Admiral!
